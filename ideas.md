# Ideas

Useful or interesting ideas and algorithms I've come across. 

Most of these can be found with Google search. 

## Working with Massive Datasets
- Frequent Itemsets: FPGrowth, APriori
- Approximate Nearest Neighbor: Locality-Sensitive-Hashing search
- Clustering: BFR algorithm, CURE algorithm

## Interpretable ML
- LIME
- Shapley values
- Method of Integrated Gradients
- Influence-directed Explanations

## Model Calibration
- Platt scaling

## Deep Neural Net Training Tricks
- Minimum Hyperspherical Energy regularization
- Using GELU / PRELU instead of RELU
- Self-supervised learning to make use of unlabelled data

## Miscellanous
- Find top K values of list in single pass: Use a priority queue of length K
- Sample list uniformly at random in single pass: Reservoir sampling
