# My Software Development Journal
A record of assorted tools, concepts, and libraries that I've used / heard of over the years and found to be effective. 

These are mostly optimized for Python development

## Dev Tools
- IDE: VSCode
- Package management: Anaconda, Poetry, Yarn

## Web Development
- Backend: Flask, FastAPI
- Frontend: ReactJS + TypeScript + Material UI

## Numerical Algorithms
- Convex optimization: CvxPy
- Interior point method: CyIpOpt
- Efficient calculation: Numba

## Deep Learning Development
- Basic framework: PyTorch
- Advanced framework: Pytorch Lightning
- Interpretable DNNs: (TODO)
- Experiment logging: Sacred
- Off-the-shelf NLP: HuggingFace
- Off-the-shelf CV: (TODO)

## Deep Learning Deployment
- Model endpoint: AWS SageMaker
- Deploy as Tensorflow: PyTorch -> ONNX -> Tensorflow

## Data Engineering
- Data versioning: DVC
- Task scheduling: Apache Airflow
- Model versioning: Weights and Biases
